Design concept

My overall concept and/or theme for this site is to create a simple yet dynamic and systematic format. 
I want each section to be well defined and well curated. 
I want the theme of the site to be modern and bold. 
I want a site that fits to my personal aesthetic which is a marriage of minimal, bold, sleek and fun. 

The way I hope to impact/affect the user is by offering a design experince that allows the user to quicky navigate through the site. 
I want the user to be able to smoothly transition from one article to the next. 
The visuals to be logical and seeks the most optimal balance between visual sensation and graphic information. 
The user to understand waht each section does and how to gain the most from the web experince. 
I want a low impact of shape, color, and contrast seeing as it could becoming overwhelming for the user.
